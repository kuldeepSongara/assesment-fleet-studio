## Color Search Web Application

# Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a front-end web application that provides users with a list of colors related to a given word. This application should have a responsive user interface and the ability to display a masonry grid of color cards with the hex value and background color for each color. The related colors should be derived from a dataset that is associated with the input word.

# Problem Description

The Color Search web application consists of the following features:

Word Input
-> Users are presented with an input field where they can type any word.
-> The application will take this word as input and use it to find related colors.

Related Color List
-> After the user enters a word, the application will retrieve a list of colors related to that word.
-> The related colors will be displayed in the form of a masonry grid of color cards.
-> Each color card will display the hex value (in contrasting color) of the color and have a background of the respective color.
-> The user should be able to see a visually appealing representation of colors related to the input word.

# Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

React: The front-end framework used to build the user interface.
JavaScript: The primary programming language for implementing the application logic.
CSS: For styling the user interface and color cards.

Usage
-> Enter a word into the input field.
-> Click the "Search" button to find colors related to the input word.
-> View the list of related colors displayed as color cards in a masonry grid.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
